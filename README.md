# Discrete-Event-Simulation-of-Hospital-Patient-Flow-Balta-Liman-Kemik-Hastanesi-


In modern healthcare systems, efficiently managing patient flows and resource utilization is critical for ensuring high-quality service delivery. The orthopedic outpatient department of a
hospital faces dynamic and complex workflows, involving initial examinations, diagnostic imaging (such as X-ray), and potential secondary screenings. To support operational decisionmaking, a discrete-event simulation model was developed, reflecting the real-world functioning of patient movements across doctors and diagnostic facilities.
The main purpose of this simulation project is to:
• Model the patient flow from arrival to departure accurately,
• Analyze the performance of key resources (doctors and X-ray rooms),
• Identify potential bottlenecks such as excessive waiting times or underutilized staff,
• Test operational scenarios to propose efficiency improvements.
Given the variability and stochastic nature of real-world hospital operations, simulation allows testing under controlled but realistic conditions without disrupting actual services.
